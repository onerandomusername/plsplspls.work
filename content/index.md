## It's not working

Take a breath.

You're unsure what to do. You've exhausted all of your methods, and none of them seem to help.

In a stressed panic, you turn to someone, or some*thing* for advice. They direct you here. Welcome to your newest resource.

First things first, take a deep breathe. You need to breathe. Panicking will not help you out here.

You will be okay.
